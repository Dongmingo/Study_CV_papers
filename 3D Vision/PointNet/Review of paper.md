# PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation

## Purpose of Paper
 <p>Point cloud is a irregular 3d data format. Due to arising issues while transforming into 3D voxel grid or collections of image. The paper suggests PointNet to directly consumes point cloud data for application of Classification, Part Segmentation, Semantic Segmentation.</p>
