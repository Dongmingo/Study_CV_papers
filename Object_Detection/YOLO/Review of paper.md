# You Only Look Once(YOLO) : Unified, Real-Time Object Detection

## Purpose of Paper
 <p>Previous Object Detection models takes quite long time compare to human's recognition system</p>

## Problems
<p> The Models for object detection problem not only classifies, but also need to determine the location of object bounding box : for previous models(e.g.DPM or R-CNN), it was seperated by post-processing. Thus it was time-consuming and hard to optimize</p>
